                                In the second year of our Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degrees, and the first year
                                in our respective
                                specialisations, we took the compulsory project-based course COMPSYS/ELECTENG 209. The
                                primary
                                objective of this course was for us to design and engineer a system with a specific
                                functionality by applying
                                the concepts learnt in both analogue electronics and embedded software development. But
                                we also had other
                                goals including gaining the fundamental knowledge, experience, skill-set and
                                professional behaviour needed
                                to succeed in the more challenging design projects we would engage in the future as
                                engineers.
                                We were tasked with designing a smart energy monitor that measures and displays the
                                amount of energy
                                consumed by a household appliance. Using the conceptual system diagram [1], we created a
                                model of this
                                system. Our model includes analogue circuitry consisting of sensors, amplifiers, and
                                filters through which the
                                input voltage and current signals can be measured by our microcontroller. This
                                microcontroller is
                                programmed by an embedded software program that converts the analogue signals to digital
                                form and
                                calculates the energy consumption together with other important information. The
                                information is then
                                transmitted to a local LCD display.
