								Bench-top power supplies are an important tool in the development and testing of
								electronic circuits. A
								typical supply such as the GW3323 provides low voltages and currents set by the user at
								its isolated outputs.
								This is achieved with a 50Hz transformer with multiple taps to step down the 230V AC
								mains supply and a
								series type linear regulator to regulate to the DC voltage as set by the user.
								The drawbacks of these power supplies result not from their performance but their
								physical properties. A
								large transformer is required because of the low frequency of the mains supply, which
								adds considerable
								weight and volume to the device. Significant heatsinks for the output linear regulator
								are also needed, further
								increasing these properties.
								There is therefore motivation to miniaturize the power supply in order to both save
								space and increase
								versatility due to its miniature size that allows it to be easily carried and used at
								different locations, provided
								there is a DC power source available as its input.

								Through this project I was able to build skills in hardware design, magnetic design,
								firmware development, and system integration.
								Develop and demonstrate sound planning, communication and collaboration skills. Develop
								and demonstrate testing, verification and validation skills. I was able to gain experience coding firmware for microcontrollers in C.
								This includes
								learning new skills such as peripheral configurations, bitshifting, UART and the digital
								implentation of an integrator.
