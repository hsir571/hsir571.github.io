								Myopia - also known as near-sightedness - is one of the most widespread eye conditions
								affecting ~34% of the global population and expected to affect almost 50% by 2050
								(Holden et al., 2016). The earlier Myopia occurs in a child’s life, the more likely it
								will develop into high myopia or extreme near-sightedness. To mitigate the progression
								of myopia in children, it is paramount to increase their daily exposure to bright light,
								as well as their time spent outdoors. The recommendation is two hours of outdoor
								activity everyday. However, as children spend most of their day at school while parents
								attend work, it can be challenging for parents to keep track of their child’s time spent
								outdoors.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our main goal was two-fold. To help parents keep track of their children’s outdoor time
								to help slow the progression of myopia and to help researchers gather valuable data to
								help in future research. The first goal was completed by the Neox Sens device and the
								Neox app. The device is used by the child to gather data from a variety of sensors which
								is sent to the app. The parents can then use the app to keep track of their child’s
								outdoor time through statistics and graphs. They can also decide if they want to
								contribute to research in myopia. If they do, they can send data to the server which the
								researchers are then able to access via our website.

							<h3>Role and Duties</h3>
							<p>
								For this project I worked as the App lead where I mostly focused on the backend of the
								app. My main duties consisted of building the database and interacting with the required
								API endpionts as well as AWS Cognito. I built the relational database for the App and
								setup up the account creation and login system. The database was built on SqLite using
								the Flutter plugin Drift. If you wish to look further into the app code <a href="https://www.capitalise.space/projects/6678b13a9df43e2d89a6588a">here</a>
